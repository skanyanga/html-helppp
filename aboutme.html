        <h1>What I was doing before</h1>
        
        <p id="floatleft">July 6th, 5.35pm-the year: 

2008, I had just completed the level 2 ICT course. 

Brimming with confidence and ambition I logically 

and with no hesitation decided to step up to the 

level 3 ICT course. Nothing could stop me, or so I 

thought. 
           
          <em>Life is full of surprises </em>
            
        my dad would always say and I would find 

that out for the first time, just how much of an 

affect that could be.  Half way into my Level 3 

course, I had an opportunity to go and study for an 

MCSE course for a company with a ready-made job 

position at the end of the course. After long 

deliberation I decided to take up the offer and left 

without finishing my course.  A year later the 

company I was studying with would declare 

bankruptcy.  I was devastated.</p> 
      
        <h2>Whyy I decided to do this course.</h2>
     
        <p>Fast forward July 6th, 5.35pm-2013, four 

years from the Level 3 ICT course. After years of 

working in Customer service job roles.  I came to 

realisation that this is not something I want to be 

doing for the rest of my life nor is it something 

that I have a passion for. I quickly decided to go 

back into education and get myself into university 

in order to get a better future as well as get 

myself into the IT Sector, something that I have 

always wanted to be.</p>
      
        
        <h2>Whaat I want to get out of this 

course.</h2>
        
        <p>I’m hoping the course will allow me to 

advance in my education in to university and cement 

myself in the IT Sector.  I hope this will be more 

evident in terms of the hard-work I have put in the 

near future. </p>

         <p>I’m hoping g I can reflect back to my 

younger days and be proud of what I have 

accomplished and reap the rewards of the hard-work I 

applied and will continue to apply in the future.  

Im also hoping to be able to build on the success I 

have obtained and hopefully start my business either 

with my partner or on my own. I also believe this 

course will allow me to learn and study various I.T 

subjects that I may have not considered such as 

forensic science which is an interesting subject to 

go into.
         
         In my spare time, I enjoy going out with 

friends, socialising etc. I am huge cinema buff so 

the occasional visit to the cinema is a must. I also 

like to travel around, it makes me feel relaxed and 

I enjoy seeing new places. “Life is not about being 

content in one position”. </p>
